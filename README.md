# CLF4SRec
## Model
Our model CLF4SRec is implemented based on the [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole). 

Both the processing of the dataset and the metrics calculation follow the implementation of RecBole.

CLF4SRec in /recbole/model/sequential_recommender/clf4srec.py
### Usage
We provide the script main_run.py to run the model
